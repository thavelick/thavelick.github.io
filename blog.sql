In it, he helped me overcome my biggest\n objections to starting. First, he convinced me that it doesn''t\n matter if I don''t come up with anything original to say:\n\n\n\n> Consider a university professor teaching a course. Does she say\n>  anything original? Do you think she should cancel her course\n>  because somebody else discovered the things she wants to teach? Or\n>  does she have to cancel her course simply because there is a\n>  similar course at some other university?\n> \n> \n> Or consider yourself. Do you avoid having conversations with\n>  your friends when you think you have nothing original to say? Do\n>  you share things with them? Do you give advice? Do you help to\n>  understand things?\n\n\nSecond, the article gave me a lot of ideas on where to find\n something to write about including:\n\n\n* Scouring old IM logs and emails for things you said that seemed\n useful to others.\n* Looking at comments you''ve made on other peoples posts.\n* Thinking about advice you repeatedly give to friends.\n* Look through notes taken when researching different\n topics.\n\n\nThis got me thinking about other sources I could use for article\n ideas and it hit me: I''d already written a lot of article\-like\n content but it was spread scattershot over the web. I then\n collected a few of these, made some minor edits and they became the\n first few articles on this site. The oldest of which I adapted from\n a StackOverflow post I wrote all the way back in 2008! If you''re\n starting a blog, you should look around the web to find things\n you''ve already written and consider adding them as back dated posts\n on the new site.\n\n\n## Where to find articles you''ve already written to add to your\n blog\n\n\nThere are a lot of places you can probably find content you''ve\n written that you can adapt to blog articles. Some you can likely\n import directly into your blog and others you might need to edit\n and or flesh out a little.\n\n\n* Posts you''ve written on third party blogging platforms like\n Medium, Blogger or BlogSpot.\n* Questions you''ve asked or answered on Q\&A websites like\n Quora, StackOverflow or StackExchange. In these cases you might\n need to edit them a bit so they make sense in a more narrative\n form, but doing so is probably quicker and easier than you\n anticipated.\n* Forum posts.\n* Entries from your personal journal (it''s probably a good idea\n to heavily edit these and obviously not post everything en\n masse).\n* Articles or documentation you''ve written for work that might be\n useful for a wider audience. Check with your boss before adapting\n any of this work, but chances are they''ll approve so long as you\n aren''t revealing anything proprietary or that could be a security\n risk.\n* If you''re a programmer, README''s from open source tools you''ve\n developed.\n* Notes you''ve taken when learning something new.\n* Content you''ve written on old, now defunct websites accessed\n through the [Wayback\n Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php).\n* Content that has been removed by changing moderation standards.\n When I wrote the original post behind my article on getting\n [my first software development\n job](/breaking-into-coding) on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)\n they allowed open ended questions. When the site decided to focus\n on questions with more definitive answers, my answer was removed by\n moderators even though many people found it useful. Adding it to my\n blog makes this long missing advice public again.\n* Long posts from Facebook or Twitter threads that others outside\n your friend circle might find useful.\n\n\n## Why you shouldn''t worry about duplicating content\n\n\nCollecting all of your writing in your blog can allow people\n that would otherwise only find one or two fragments of your writing\n to read all you''ve had to say if they are so inclined.\n\n\nAlso, it''s a great motivational exercise. It makes writing seem\n like a less daunting and new task. Once doing it, you''ll realize\n you''ve actually been writing for years, and now have something to\n show for it. That should make future writing easier.\n\n\nSEO experts sometimes rail against duplicate content. This might\n make you think I''m crazy for advocating using it. However,\n generally [duplicate content won''t penalize your rankings](https://searchengineland.com/myth-duplicate-content-penalty-259657), it just won''t\n count positively toward your rankings so content from the original\n site might rank more highly that the one on your new blog. If\n you''re really worried about this you can add a `noindex`\n meta tag to the page to make search engines ignore it. That way at\n least people who come to your blog through other articles can still\n get value out of it.\n\n\n## It doesn''t matter that your old writing wasn''t that great\n\n\nThink about one of your favorite blogs. One you''ve read for\n years perhaps. Go there, and click into the author''s archives and\n read their first few posts. Chances are they will suck compared to\n what they''re posting today. It''s natural for writing to improve\n over time and for your thinking on a topic to change. Make minor\n (or even major) edits if you feel the need. Write some introductory\n text that gives context about what was happening when you wrote the\n article.\n\n\n## Don''t stop with the old stuff\n\n\nOf course, the idea here is not to just collect a bunch of old\n personal writing artifacts, but to give your blog (and your brain)\n a bit of a jump start. Once you''ve added a few older articles,\n spend some time to write some new ones. If your thoughts on a topic\n have changed, write a follow up post.

I couldn’t restart from a save point. I\n    couldn’t even play again and be faced with the same maps and\n    enemies again armed with my newly acquired knowledge of what to\n    find where, because the levels in this game are randomly generated\n    each time you play. This very likely sounds awful but it’s not. As\n    far as I can tell, there are two reasons for this being awesome\n    instead of horrible.</p>\n    <p>First, this kind of “permadeath” really ratchets up the\n    intensity of the game. When you’re staring down a giant ogre with a\n    spiked club he looks like something my cat could draw on the\n    screen. But when he has the power to wipe out hours of effort in a\n    single turn he becomes incredibly scary in your mind’s eye. And if\n    you’re otherwise doing well you’ll do anything in your power to\n    survive. In my recent game, I felt this kind of thrilling moment\n    over and over again. I stumbled upon a very powerful weapon called\n    a Dark Maul. This thing was several times more powerful than any\n    normal weapon in the game, but had the disadvantage of being\n    extremely slow. I could take out almost any enemy in a single hefty\n    hit of this beast of a hammer, but then I’d be left at the mercy of\n    any other enemies as I worked to lift it over my head to attack\n    again. Despite the disadvantage I was doing well, carefully luring\n    enemies into hallways where I could take them on one by one, acting\n    as a one man Spartain Army in my personal Pass of Thermopylae. If\n    things got to be too much, I could run up stairs, kill off any\n    close enemies that followed and head back down to the waiting\n    horde. If I got into a bind, I could use a scroll of teleportation\n    to wisk myself away to a random location in the dungeon. Of course,\n    this is what ended up doing me in. I teleported away from some\n    enemies while at deaths door into a gauntlet of still more enemies\n    and before I could move I was hit by a fireball from an otherwise\n    weak and typically harmless orcish wizard. The moments leading up\n    to that death were some of the most thrilling I’ve experienced in a\n    game.</p>\n    <p><em>My Final Moments</em>: <img src=\n    "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3664/1*6hEdaggcmFDCg0wKjV_Y-g.png"\n    alt="My Final Moments"></p>\n    <p>And this leads me to the second reason I really like this\n    particular game.

I published it here on 11/21/2020]</em></p>\n    <p>When I was in high school, one of my teachers told us a story of when he was in college. A friend of his wanted a job as a DJ for the university''s radio station so he bought a huge rock and roll encyclopedia, and carried it around everywhere he went. A few months later when a position opened, he was offered the DJ job. Everyone saw him with that book, and assumed he was an expert in subject. The thing was, he never actually read a word of the book.</p>\n    <p>Now, you won''t get a job coding simply by carrying around a PHP and not reading it. However my teacher''s story inspired me to continuously learn new technologies and to do so conspicuously, letting everyone know in both subtle and non-subtle ways what I was are learning.</p>\n    <p>Months after hearing this story, I was a a freshman at University, and I was very anxious to start coding professionally. I''d been coding in Atari Basic, and then (now) old versions of Visual Basic since I was 8 years old, and didn''t want to wait until I graduated four years later to start making money with it. I was teaching myself HTML and (Classic) ASP on the side, and really came to like web development.</p>\n    <p>I wasn''t very confident in my abilities at that point, and I just wanted to get some kind of a job working with computers at a company that had a development department. In that vein, I applied for a job at a local Internet Service Provider who was hiring folks to support their Dial-Up Internet service. I got the job, and I''m fairly certain it was due to the fact that I was carrying around O''reily''s TCP/IP Networking book when I went to the interview and this impressed the interviewer.</p>\n    <p>After getting my foot in the door, instead of spending my lunch hours eating with people in the support department or alone, I''d walk up to the web development department and bug the folks there. I''d show them what I was working on for little side projects, and they''d show me what they were working on. I would hang out behind them, watching them code (they didn''t seem to mind) and soon I was making suggestions when they got stuck. A while later, I''d come up and volunteer to help code things (on my own) in the evenings when they were close to a deadline (for free).</p>\n    <p>After a few months of this, they offered me a job in the department, when one of the other developers left.</p>\n    <p>So in summary:</p>\n    <ol>\n    <li>Always be learning new things, and make sure people know you are learning them. Don''t just fake it like my teacher''s friend.</li>\n    <li>Work on your own development projects. This is the most important thing. You need to be able to show people your can actually get stuff done.</li>\n    <li>Don''t be afraid to get a non-coding job to get your foot in the door.</li>\n    <li>If you do (3), spend as much free time as possible working with the people in the company who actually do programming, but make sure you are providing value.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Of course, this strategy wouldn''t work for everyone, and wouldn''t work at every company, but it can work.</p>\n  </div>\n\n\n</body></html>\n','\n',char(10)),replace('<p><em>[This article is based on a stack overflow answer that was deleted after the site moved away from more open ended questions.

A friend of his wanted a job as a DJ for the university''s radio station so he bought a huge rock and roll encyclopedia, and carried it around everywhere he went. A few months later when a position opened, he was offered the DJ job. Everyone saw him with that book, and assumed he was an expert in subject. The thing was, he never actually read a word of the book.\n\n\nNow, you won''t get a job coding simply by carrying around a PHP and not reading it.

They verify that\n        you are who you say you are by asking you to provide a photo of your ID. Once you''ve\n        provided that, they verify you and you get a blue checkmark next to your name. Up to now\n        Twitter did this at their own discretion, but they recently announced that they may start\n        making this a paid feature.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On Mastodon, there''s no centralized authority that can verify folks in the same way as\n        Twitter.

To do this, just\n        hit the copy button to the right of where you added your website on your Mastodon profile\n        page, under "Verification".

This says "this link is to a page that I control and\n        represents me".\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Then, you just add that code somewhere on the home page of your site.

In most cases if I want to watch a movie, I''ll Tivo it, or\nwatch it on Netflix. If I want to listen to music, more often than\nnot in the pas t few months, I''ll visit Pandora. Truth be told,\nprior to my reunion with Pandora I''d pirated a lot of music, but\nthat activity has greatly slowed recently. Whenever I do want to\nlisten to specific music, I''ll acquire it digitally, or at the very\nleast get a CD and immediately rip it to digital format, with the\nCD itself rarely to be seen again. I also very rarely buy physical\nbooks these days. Unless I''m reading something obscure, I almost\nalways read on my Kindle.</p>\n<p>Yet, as I look around my apartment I see shelf after shelf of\nmovies I like, but rarely watch.

And yet, a sense\nof foreboding comes over me as the day after Christmas\napproaches.</p>\n<p>Despite my being an atheist, Christmas is by far my favorite\nholiday. I love spending time with family, eating, drinking and\ntalking. I love the spirit of giving and honest camaraderie. I love\nto see the expressions on everyone''s faces when they get something\nthey really wanted. I even really love the feeling I get when I\nmyself open a really creative and unique gift I hadn''t even thought\nof buying myself, or that one thing I was really hoping for.</p>\n<p>That said, I have in some ways come to dread the day after\nchristmas. When I come home, much of the revelry has passed and I\nhave got a brand new batch of stuff to layer atop my existing\npossessions. Its not that I don''t like them, its that I really hate\nstoring them. I live in a small condo and really don''t want to\n"upgrade"my housing just to accommodate more stuff.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I''ve come to realize of late that I get much\nmore enjoyment out of doing things than having things. I really\nenjoyed the last couple books I read, but I enjoy discussing such\nbooks with people almost more than reading. I enjoy listening to\nmusic, but I most enjoy hearing new music a friend recommended, or\ngoing to a concert (either classical or rock). Overall, I''ve found\nthat more happiness comes from gaining memories rather than\npossessions. I''ve even seen a lot of research to back up that\nproposition.

I know when I was younger and had a severe shortage of\nstuff, I would have been disappointed if my Christmas consisted of\nthings from the above list. Also, many times a physical gift really\nis best. If you are endowed with amazing talent at creating or\nfinding unique gifts, keep it up.
