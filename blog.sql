INSERT INTO posts VALUES(5,'already-blogging','Already Blogging',replace('My recent return to updating my website and finally getting\n around to starting a blog on my own site was inspired in large part\n by Alexey Guzey''s article on [Why you should start\n a blog right now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/). In it, he helped me overcome my biggest\n objections to starting. First, he convinced me that it doesn''t\n matter if I don''t come up with anything original to say:\n\n\n\n> Consider a university professor teaching a course. Does she say\n>  anything original? Do you think she should cancel her course\n>  because somebody else discovered the things she wants to teach? Or\n>  does she have to cancel her course simply because there is a\n>  similar course at some other university?\n> \n> \n> Or consider yourself. Do you avoid having conversations with\n>  your friends when you think you have nothing original to say? Do\n>  you share things with them? Do you give advice? Do you help to\n>  understand things?\n\n\nSecond, the article gave me a lot of ideas on where to find\n something to write about including:\n\n\n* Scouring old IM logs and emails for things you said that seemed\n useful to others.\n* Looking at comments you''ve made on other peoples posts.\n* Thinking about advice you repeatedly give to friends.\n* Look through notes taken when researching different\n topics.\n\n\nThis got me thinking about other sources I could use for article\n ideas and it hit me: I''d already written a lot of article\-like\n content but it was spread scattershot over the web. I then\n collected a few of these, made some minor edits and they became the\n first few articles on this site. The oldest of which I adapted from\n a StackOverflow post I wrote all the way back in 2008! If you''re\n starting a blog, you should look around the web to find things\n you''ve already written and consider adding them as back dated posts\n on the new site.\n\n\n## Where to find articles you''ve already written to add to your\n blog\n\n\nThere are a lot of places you can probably find content you''ve\n written that you can adapt to blog articles. Some you can likely\n import directly into your blog and others you might need to edit\n and or flesh out a little.\n\n\n* Posts you''ve written on third party blogging platforms like\n Medium, Blogger or BlogSpot.\n* Questions you''ve asked or answered on Q\&A websites like\n Quora, StackOverflow or StackExchange. In these cases you might\n need to edit them a bit so they make sense in a more narrative\n form, but doing so is probably quicker and easier than you\n anticipated.\n* Forum posts.\n* Entries from your personal journal (it''s probably a good idea\n to heavily edit these and obviously not post everything en\n masse).\n* Articles or documentation you''ve written for work that might be\n useful for a wider audience. Check with your boss before adapting\n any of this work, but chances are they''ll approve so long as you\n aren''t revealing anything proprietary or that could be a security\n risk.\n* If you''re a programmer, README''s from open source tools you''ve\n developed.\n* Notes you''ve taken when learning something new.\n* Content you''ve written on old, now defunct websites accessed\n through the [Wayback\n Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php).\n* Content that has been removed by changing moderation standards.\n When I wrote the original post behind my article on getting\n [my first software development\n job](/breaking-into-coding) on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)\n they allowed open ended questions. When the site decided to focus\n on questions with more definitive answers, my answer was removed by\n moderators even though many people found it useful. Adding it to my\n blog makes this long missing advice public again.\n* Long posts from Facebook or Twitter threads that others outside\n your friend circle might find useful.\n\n\n## Why you shouldn''t worry about duplicating content\n\n\nCollecting all of your writing in your blog can allow people\n that would otherwise only find one or two fragments of your writing\n to read all you''ve had to say if they are so inclined.\n\n\nAlso, it''s a great motivational exercise. It makes writing seem\n like a less daunting and new task. Once doing it, you''ll realize\n you''ve actually been writing for years, and now have something to\n show for it. That should make future writing easier.\n\n\nSEO experts sometimes rail against duplicate content. This might\n make you think I''m crazy for advocating using it. However,\n generally [duplicate content won''t penalize your rankings](https://searchengineland.com/myth-duplicate-content-penalty-259657), it just won''t\n count positively toward your rankings so content from the original\n site might rank more highly that the one on your new blog. If\n you''re really worried about this you can add a `noindex`\n meta tag to the page to make search engines ignore it. That way at\n least people who come to your blog through other articles can still\n get value out of it.\n\n\n## It doesn''t matter that your old writing wasn''t that great\n\n\nThink about one of your favorite blogs. One you''ve read for\n years perhaps. Go there, and click into the author''s archives and\n read their first few posts. Chances are they will suck compared to\n what they''re posting today. It''s natural for writing to improve\n over time and for your thinking on a topic to change. Make minor\n (or even major) edits if you feel the need. Write some introductory\n text that gives context about what was happening when you wrote the\n article.\n\n\n## Don''t stop with the old stuff\n\n\nOf course, the idea here is not to just collect a bunch of old\n personal writing artifacts, but to give your blog (and your brain)\n a bit of a jump start. Once you''ve added a few older articles,\n spend some time to write some new ones. If your thoughts on a topic\n have changed, write a follow up post. Or write something entirely\n different.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'2020-11-23 17:00:00','Reflecting on the motivation behind starting a blog, sharing personal insights and avenues for finding past writings to enrich content.');
INSERT INTO posts VALUES(6,'ps4','PS4',replace('*\[This article has been adapted from a post I wrote at\n Medium, years ago. It was revised and published here on\n 2020\-11\-21]*\n\n\n![cover image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pYOJ7QeG4cAoI1t9TjPTyA.jpeg)\n\n\nFor Christmas 2015 I got a new PlayStation 4, which was pretty\n damn awesome. It has amazing graphics, and with it came this really\n sweet open world game, Fallout 4, where you play as a survivor in\n this post\-apocalyptic world that people probably spent years\n painstakingly creating detail after detail. Its pretty fun and\n impressive. But I barely played it in the weeks following recieving\n it.\n\n\nInstead, I spent most of my time playing this Free/Open Source\n game first released 20 years ago (in some form). The game’s\n graphics (at their best) look like this:\n\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2034/1*vb2J01WJlJWlOcVNZJZZ8A.png)\n\n\nIt’s called [Dungeon\n Crawl: Stone Soup,](http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/) and I’ve been a little obsessed. Why? In\n this game you can actually die. Just now, I played the game for 2\n hours, took a misstep and my character died. And that was it. I\n couldn’t be regenerated. I couldn’t restart from a save point. I\n couldn’t even play again and be faced with the same maps and\n enemies again armed with my newly acquired knowledge of what to\n find where, because the levels in this game are randomly generated\n each time you play. This very likely sounds awful but it’s not. As\n far as I can tell, there are two reasons for this being awesome\n instead of horrible.\n\n\nFirst, this kind of “permadeath” really ratchets up the\n intensity of the game. When you’re staring down a giant ogre with a\n spiked club he looks like something my cat could draw on the\n screen. But when he has the power to wipe out hours of effort in a\n single turn he becomes incredibly scary in your mind’s eye. And if\n you’re otherwise doing well you’ll do anything in your power to\n survive. In my recent game, I felt this kind of thrilling moment\n over and over again. I stumbled upon a very powerful weapon called\n a Dark Maul. This thing was several times more powerful than any\n normal weapon in the game, but had the disadvantage of being\n extremely slow. I could take out almost any enemy in a single hefty\n hit of this beast of a hammer, but then I’d be left at the mercy of\n any other enemies as I worked to lift it over my head to attack\n again. Despite the disadvantage I was doing well, carefully luring\n enemies into hallways where I could take them on one by one, acting\n as a one man Spartain Army in my personal Pass of Thermopylae. If\n things got to be too much, I could run up stairs, kill off any\n close enemies that followed and head back down to the waiting\n horde. If I got into a bind, I could use a scroll of teleportation\n to wisk myself away to a random location in the dungeon. Of course,\n this is what ended up doing me in. I teleported away from some\n enemies while at deaths door into a gauntlet of still more enemies\n and before I could move I was hit by a fireball from an otherwise\n weak and typically harmless orcish wizard. The moments leading up\n to that death were some of the most thrilling I’ve experienced in a\n game.\n\n\n*My Final Moments*: ![My Final Moments](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3664/1*6hEdaggcmFDCg0wKjV_Y-g.png)\n\n\nAnd this leads me to the second reason I really like this\n particular game. I could have done better. I could have used an\n ability called “Berserk” to send my character into an inferno of\n adrenaline fueled rage that maybe, just maybe would have given me\n enough speed and energy to get away to a more defensible position.\n DCSS is just one in a long line of “Roguelikes” games that share\n it’s randomly generated dungeons and permanent death. The thing for\n me that sets it apart from other Roguelikes I’ve played is every\n time I die, I feel like I could have done better. I feel like if\n I’d just thought about my last move a little bit longer, or used a\n better strategy to avoid getting in such a tight spot, but I\n didn’t. My death was my fault, not due to just an unfortunate roll\n of the dice. Other rogue likes seem to spring surprises on you that\n with your limited resources are simply too weak to deal with. In\n classics of the genere like Nethack or the original rogue, people\n spend sometimes years between wins, waiting for that perfect game\n to come along.\n\n\nDCSS keeps driving me to play again and again. It has a small\n enough complexity to be easy enough to wrap my mind around, yet a\n large enough variety to keep me coming back and trying new things.\n Big polished AAA games have their appeal and I certainly returned\n to them over the lifetime of the PS4\. But then I''d find myself\n drawn back into the lofi dungeon to see if this time I might\n survive just a little while longer this time...\n\n','\n',char(10)),'2016-01-02 17:00:00','A personal reflection on why the nostalgic roguelike Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup captivates, even in the face of a powerful PS4.

He reminds us to adjust adjust\n our environment to what we need even if it''s inconvenient to others.\n\n\nThe story reminded me a burnout combatting strategy I''d used in the past: **Slow\n down and focus on craftsmanship**. Often burnout comes when you feel stress always\n be getting something done, always moving on to the next thing that''s needed. Instead of\n getting things done as quickly as possibly, it can help to take the slow route. Zoom in on\n the little details. Take a lot more time to make what you''re working on as perfect as you\n can. In a software development context, is each variable name as good as it could be? Could\n any lines of code be removed? Could we make it perform faster? If what you''re working on\n feels repetitive, could you make the computer do the work for you? Could the code be\n rewritten to be more readable?\n\n\nWhen it works, this strategy helps me find the beauty in my work again. Sometimes I go a\n bit overboard and end up with an over\-engineered mess I have to throw away. But when I do,\n the quick solution and simple solution I started with ends up feeling much better as now\n I''ve seen the flaws in the alternative. And of course, burnout can be caused by the reverse\n too. Sometimes, if I''ve been to in the weeds of the details and too focused on making\n things perfect it can help to step back and come up with a quick and un\-elegant solution\n instead.\n\n\nThe feeling of burnout is your brain''s way of telling you that something needs to\n change. So, the next time that feeling settles upon you consider that perhaps the solution\n is as simple as changing the pace and focus of your work.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'2020-12-05 17:00:00','Examining the benefits of slowing down to tackle burnout, this post highlights strategies for finding joy in work and improving craftsmanship.');
INSERT INTO posts VALUES(10,'breaking-into-coding','How I Got My First Programming Job',replace('*\[This article is based on a stack overflow answer that was deleted after the site moved away from more open ended questions. I published it here on 11/21/2020]*\n\n\nWhen I was in high school, one of my teachers told us a story of when he was in college. A friend of his wanted a job as a DJ for the university''s radio station so he bought a huge rock and roll encyclopedia, and carried it around everywhere he went. A few months later when a position opened, he was offered the DJ job. Everyone saw him with that book, and assumed he was an expert in subject. The thing was, he never actually read a word of the book.\n\n\nNow, you won''t get a job coding simply by carrying around a PHP and not reading it. However my teacher''s story inspired me to continuously learn new technologies and to do so conspicuously, letting everyone know in both subtle and non\-subtle ways what I was are learning.\n\n\nMonths after hearing this story, I was a a freshman at University, and I was very anxious to start coding professionally. I''d been coding in Atari Basic, and then (now) old versions of Visual Basic since I was 8 years old, and didn''t want to wait until I graduated four years later to start making money with it. I was teaching myself HTML and (Classic) ASP on the side, and really came to like web development.\n\n\nI wasn''t very confident in my abilities at that point, and I just wanted to get some kind of a job working with computers at a company that had a development department. In that vein, I applied for a job at a local Internet Service Provider who was hiring folks to support their Dial\-Up Internet service. I got the job, and I''m fairly certain it was due to the fact that I was carrying around O''reily''s TCP/IP Networking book when I went to the interview and this impressed the interviewer.\n\n\nAfter getting my foot in the door, instead of spending my lunch hours eating with people in the support department or alone, I''d walk up to the web development department and bug the folks there. I''d show them what I was working on for little side projects, and they''d show me what they were working on. I would hang out behind them, watching them code (they didn''t seem to mind) and soon I was making suggestions when they got stuck. A while later, I''d come up and volunteer to help code things (on my own) in the evenings when they were close to a deadline (for free).\n\n\nAfter a few months of this, they offered me a job in the department, when one of the other developers left.\n\n\nSo in summary:\n\n\n1. Always be learning new things, and make sure people know you are learning them. Don''t just fake it like my teacher''s friend.\n2. Work on your own development projects. This is the most important thing. You need to be able to show people your can actually get stuff done.\n3. Don''t be afraid to get a non\-coding job to get your foot in the door.\n4. If you do (3\), spend as much free time as possible working with the people in the company who actually do programming, but make sure you are providing value.\n\n\nOf course, this strategy wouldn''t work for everyone, and wouldn''t work at every company, but it can work.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'2008-12-04 17:00:00','A personal journey of landing a first programming job through learning, networking, and seizing opportunities in tech.');

Verification works really differently on Mastodon than it does on Twitter\n and is a little technical, so this post serves as a step by step guid for anyone who is at\n risk of being impersonated on Mastodon.\n \n\n\n## Differences from Twitter\n\n\n\n On Twitter, verification is a process that is handled by Twitter staff. They verify that\n you are who you say you are by asking you to provide a photo of your ID. Once you''ve\n provided that, they verify you and you get a blue checkmark next to your name. Up to now\n Twitter did this at their own discretion, but they recently announced that they may start\n making this a paid feature.\n \n\n\n\n On Mastodon, there''s no centralized authority that can verify folks in the same way as\n Twitter. Instead you can verify yourself by putting a link to your website in your bio,\n then linking back to your Mastodon account from your website in a special way.\n \n\n\n## Linking to your site From Mastodon\n\n\nNote:  **I''m assuming in these instructions that you''re using a PC and are interacting with\n your Mastodon account with a web browser.** Certain features are different or missing from\n the mobile website and from the mobile apps, so if you''re on your phone things might be a\n little different.\n \n\n\n\n The first step in verifying yourself is linking from your Mastodon profile to your website.\n This should be your public website that people trust is run by you or your organization.\n To do this, follow these steps:\n \n\n1. Go to your profile page on Mastodon. Click on "Edit Profile" under your username on the left.\n2. Scroll down to the "Metadata" section, towards the bottom of the page. In the first row,\n type "Website" in the box on the left and the full URL of your website in the box on the\n right. Your website URL should start with `https://`. For example, for my site\n I put `https://tristanhavelick.com`.\n3. Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n This will add a link to your website in your profile. However this isn''t enough to verify\n you.\n \n## Linking back to your Mastodon account from your website\n\n\n\n Now, you need to add a link to your Mastodon account from your website. The easiest way to\n do this is to steal the bit of HTML code that Mastodon generates for you. To do this, just\n hit the copy button to the right of where you added your website on your Mastodon profile\n page, under "Verification". The HTML code will look something like this:\n \n\n\n```\n<a href="https://your-mastodon.site/@YourMastodonUser" rel="me">Mastodon</a>\n```\n\n\n\n The important bit here is the `rel="me"` part. This says "this link is to a page that I control and\n represents me".\n \n\n\n\n Then, you just add that code somewhere on the home page of your site. (If you don''t maintain\n the code on your website contact whoever does and send them the link to this article along\n with the link to this to your Mastodon, they should be able to help from there.\n \n\n\n\n Once you''ve done that, you should be verified on Mastodon. You can check by going to your\n profile page on Mastodon and looking for the little checkmark next to your username.\n \n\n\n## This solution isn''t perfect\n\n\n\n Even with this solution, it''s still possible that someone could impersonate you on Mastodon.\n This verification is only as reliable as the websites that you link to. If someone were to\n create a website that looks like yours, they could link to their cloned Mastodon account from\n that. But it''s better than nothing, and Twitter verification has it''s flaws as well.\n Have you seen how many verified Elon Musks there are on Twitter these days?\n \n\n','\n',char(10)),'2022-11-06 00:00:00','Understanding the unique verification process on Mastodon compared to Twitter, with step-by-step guidance for protecting your identity.');

True, I can''t go down to\ncherry creek mall and buy the most expensive watch they have, but\nI''ve never had much of a taste for luxury anyhow. I can however,\nhead down to the music store and buy any CD I want. Had I the\ninclination, I could visit Best Buy and purchase any DVD I wanted.\nThe same can be said about a visit to Tattered Cover, my local\nbookshop and obtain a copy of anything I desired to read. In any\ncase, I could probably get away with doing these things quite\noften.\n\n\nThe preceding paragraph was not written out of a desire to brag.\nThe fact is, with very little determination and the ability to bend\n(okay break) a little copyright law, or dare I say, visit your\nlocal library you too can have similar ability even when living\nhand to mouth.\n\n\nStrange as it may seem, given the ability to own all this media\nand physical goods, I have recently come to procure less and less\nof it. In most cases if I want to watch a movie, I''ll Tivo it, or\nwatch it on Netflix. If I want to listen to music, more often than\nnot in the pas t few months, I''ll visit Pandora. Truth be told,\nprior to my reunion with Pandora I''d pirated a lot of music, but\nthat activity has greatly slowed recently. Whenever I do want to\nlisten to specific music, I''ll acquire it digitally, or at the very\nleast get a CD and immediately rip it to digital format, with the\nCD itself rarely to be seen again. I also very rarely buy physical\nbooks these days. Unless I''m reading something obscure, I almost\nalways read on my Kindle.\n\n\nYet, as I look around my apartment I see shelf after shelf of\nmovies I like, but rarely watch. I see bookshelves filled so much\nthat books are stacked in front of other books. The phenomenon\ncontinues as I look to my kitchen, filled with gadgets rarely used,\nand cookbooks rarely opened.\n\n\nJulia (my wife) and I spent a lot of time today clearing things\nout and getting rid of a lot of junk we''ve acquired over the years,\nand although we have a lot to go, it finally feels more than just\nclean\-\- It has some semblance of being organized. And yet, a sense\nof foreboding comes over me as the day after Christmas\napproaches.\n\n\nDespite my being an atheist, Christmas is by far my favorite\nholiday. I love spending time with family, eating, drinking and\ntalking. I love the spirit of giving and honest camaraderie. I love\nto see the expressions on everyone''s faces when they get something\nthey really wanted. I even really love the feeling I get when I\nmyself open a really creative and unique gift I hadn''t even thought\nof buying myself, or that one thing I was really hoping for.\n\n\nThat said, I have in some ways come to dread the day after\nchristmas. When I come home, much of the revelry has passed and I\nhave got a brand new batch of stuff to layer atop my existing\npossessions. Its not that I don''t like them, its that I really hate\nstoring them. I live in a small condo and really don''t want to\n"upgrade"my housing just to accommodate more stuff.\n\n\nAt the same time, I''ve come to realize of late that I get much\nmore enjoyment out of doing things than having things. I really\nenjoyed the last couple books I read, but I enjoy discussing such\nbooks with people almost more than reading. I enjoy listening to\nmusic, but I most enjoy hearing new music a friend recommended, or\ngoing to a concert (either classical or rock). Overall, I''ve found\nthat more happiness comes from gaining memories rather than\npossessions. I''ve even seen a lot of research to back up that\nproposition. On that note, I have the following suggestions to gift\ngivers out there:\n\n\n* If you''re going to give some kind of media give the digital kind, if the recipient is like me and is so inclined.\n* Instead of giving someone an art book, offer to visit your favorite museum with them, or buy them a membership.\n* Instead of giving someone a DVD, buy them some movie tickets and offer to join them.\n* In lieu of a CD, offer to take someone to a concert, play, musical, or symphony.\n* Rather than giving a cookbook or gadget, invite your recipient over to cook something with you or clip a few of your own favorite recipes.\n\n\nSure, there are many out there who like getting stuff for\nChristmas. I know when I was younger and had a severe shortage of\nstuff, I would have been disappointed if my Christmas consisted of\nthings from the above list. Also, many times a physical gift really\nis best. If you are endowed with amazing talent at creating or\nfinding unique gifts, keep it up. A place can always be found for\nsomething truly heartfelt or amazing. But if your Christmas\nshopping typically consists of a visit to the mall, best buy, or a\nweb superstore, and you can''t figure out what to give to your\nWookie friend when he already owns too many combs (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSWCQ7ALEms)) ,\ngive the above list a shot.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'2010-11-30 17:00:00','Reflections on consumer goods post-Christmas, emphasizing the joy of experiences over possessions and thoughtful gift-giving ideas.');

Sure,\n a Roman Emperor could monitor and exact revenge on those he didn''t like close to home, but\n managing every aspect of people''s lives in a city thousands of miles away was impossible.\n In the 20th century, with technology like the telegraph, totalitarianism came about.\n Stalin, for instance, could plant spies and get reports from across the entirety of the U.S.S.R\n and control things at a greater distance with greater ease.\n In fact, getting too much information was often a more difficult problem than not having enough.\n One of the things Harari argues is that AI technology will make it easy for totalitarians to\n micromanage across vast areas even more effectively because it can collect and filter through\n large sets of data about people to identify potential bad actors. China''s social reputation\n scoring system might be an example of this that already exists.\n \n\n\n\n But, he brings up the point that AI, on the other hand, could be used to fight against such total\n control.\n If dissidents against a totalitarian power can make bots that share anti government ideas\n online without being traceable back to the original author, perhaps AI can help those fighting\n gain their own reach.\n \n\n\n\n Beyond giving me some ideas on how to think about how AI might affect the world, the book really\n drove home for me that History can be an interesting lens to look at current and future events\n through.\n I haven''t generally read a lot of history, but maybe that should change.\n \n\n','\n',char(10)),'2024-12-01 12:31:00','Insights from Yuval Harari''s *Nexus* on AI''s impact on society''s power dynamics and the historical lens for understanding modern events.');

By the time they released the rewritten version, it was so riddled with bugs that the team decided to scrap it. [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) called this "The worst strategic mistake that any software company can make". As a new professional, his message was clear and haunted me for years to come.\n\nBut a codebase without direction and planning can indeed really get out of hand. Much later in my career, a website I worked on with tons of ad-hoc PHP and spaghetti jQuery was getting incredibly hard to work with. Not having effective front-end unit tests or clear logic separation made rollbacks and merge conflicts happen. More than one high impact initiative was cancelled due to missed deadlines. We knew the current path wasn''t going to work in the long run. But I knew that doing a rewrite from scratch could potentially end the company. So what to do?\n\nTasked with finding a way out of this, I dove into researching and found it''s not the rewrite that''s dangerous. It''s lack of feedback. The longer you work on a project without getting it into the hands of the people who''ll use it, the worse off you''ll be. That leaves two options do it fast, or do it slow, one piece at a time.\n\nIn the case of the PHP/jQuery migration we went with the second option as there was too much to do to be fast. We took advantage of the [Strangler Fig pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html). We began by started moving core back-end functionality to Python/Flask API server. Then we moved bits of functionality, page by page, component by component over to a new Next.js/React system. We put a reverse proxy on from the old server to the new one that we could activate on a URL by URL basis. We started with a simple page as a proof of concept, but once we had that, we started moving our most changing and highest traffic routes over. Within less than a month we saw the benefits of faster page load times, easier collaboration and quicker implementation of split tests. Over time, more and more pages lived on the new system. All of it was turned on, in production, in front of customers from day one. No development branch lived for more than a week or so without being merged in. And it worked. After a few years, we''d migrated 98% of the application to the new systems with no giant rollbacks, no crunch time and no regrets. The new system isn''t perfect. It has some of the dependency hell kind of problems that plague a lot of React/Next projects. But it works well overall and is a far cry from where we used to be.\n\nYou''re not stuck choosing between a complete, existentially risky write and languishing in a buggy, hard-to-work with code base. You can escape to something better. And with LLM-based code completion like GitHub Copilot and agentic development environments like [Aider](https://aider.chat) and Cursor, you can probably do such a migration a heck of a lot faster than we did. On a recent undertaking, I saw  this firsthand when I moved my manually edited HTML-only (and admittedly much smaller) personal site to a database-driven flask site using a similar process. This time the bulk of the work was done in less than 24 hours. More on that next time.\n\nDid you find this article valuable?

We ended up sitting with our friend’s priest and his wife. At first, my mind was a little conflicted with the prospect of spending a meal talking to a Christian Priest. On the one hand, I had had some bad experiences with Christianity as a child, and it had turned me away from the Chruch and spirituality in general for many years. On the other hand, I’d been doing a lot of spiritual reading of late and was eager to get an enlightened Christian perspective. I set my prejudices aside and greeted the priest with an open mind.\n\n\nFather Stace turned out to be quite wise and charismatic. We discussed his life as a Priest in training, my dabbling in Buddhism, Hinduism and “New Age” readings, his blog, movies and more. I mentioned that I had attempted to read the Bible a few times and struggled with its immense length. He recommend I start with a few books of the New Testament first, which I plan to do. He could somehow tell that I was interested in the more spiritual side of Christianity and recommended I read, The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality. I wasn’t really enjoying the other book I was reading at the time, so the next day I went out and bought it. I’m quite glad I did.\n\n\nIn some of my other studies I had heard about Christian Mysticism and that it had some similarities with East Asian spiritual paths, but when I researched it online everything was a bit over my head from a theological perspective. The Mountain of Silence was a great change. Written from the perspective of a western academic who had studied other spiritual ideas than Christianity, it was a great change of pace. I won’t try to summarize the book, as I’m sure you can get an idea from Amazon, but here are some ideas that seemed to strike a chord with me:\n\n\n* The Athonite monks recommend a practice of “Ceaseless Prayer” in which a novice monk will repeat the Jesus Prayer (something like “Lord Jesus Christ, Have Mercy on me, a sinner”) until it persisted constantly in the background behind the thought of worldly concerns. This reminded me of the Buddhist/New Age concepts of meditation involving stopping thought. I imagine that while repeating the prayer, one does not have the time for worldly thoughts, and enters a very meditative\-like state. It reminds me of Tolle’s idea that useful thoughts will emerge “from the stillness” in a person who focuses solely on the present moment. The Greek Orthodox concept of Logosimoi also rang of this.\n\n\n* The concept of Hell outlined by Maximos and the other monks from the Mountain seems much plausible than the fire and brimstone picture we get from Christian Fundamentalism and Dante. First, it is not simply unending torture. The monk tells several stories of sinful folk ascending to heaven after death, due to the prayer’s of monks and others on the worldly plane. He also explains that the real suffering in Hell comes from being cut off from God, not necessarily physical pain know here on earth.\n\n* Suffering as a doorway to God. This reminded me so much of Tich Naht Hanh, the Buddhist monk and author, that several times I had to check the title of the book just to be sure of what I was reading.\n\n* Spiritual insight as a “Scientific” practice. Although any practicing scientist would scoff, Father Maximos proposed that spiritual growth is a somewhat scientific process. He said that for spiritual pursuits we must use the proper tools to investigate: Prayer, studying the scriptures, Fasting etc. I would add Meditation and perhaps even rational reductionism ala Hobbes and Descartes to this list. Now, before any of you scientists jump down my throat, I am aware that most things of the spiritual world won’t hold up to a strictly objective scientific method, but taking a more personal/subjective perspective it makes sense.\n\nThrough reading The Mountain of Silence, I''ve gained a new respect for the Jewish/Christian tradition. Although I don’t plan on rushing out to attend church every Sunday, Christianity will no longer be absent from my reading lists.\n\nThe wider my breadth of spiritual knowledge and wisdom becomes, the more I realize that all truly enlightened people are all talking about the same things. Terrorism, War and Famine might be all things of the past if people learned from their truly enlightened spiritual guides rather than blindly following interpretations of “Holy” texts that happen to meet their worldly wishes at the moment.','\n',char(10)),'2006-10-06 00:00:00','Reflections on a conversation with a priest and insights gained from Christian mysticism, exploring parallels with Eastern spirituality and personal growth.');

They’ll show through the laws of supply and demand that price caps cause shortages, that subsidies cause undue surpluses, that monopolies and inter-company collusion cause higher prices and lower wages for workers, and that labor unions and minimum wage laws cause higher unemployment and less efficiency in the economy as a whole.\n\nEconomists will typically preface such analyses with a phrase such as, “All else held equal” that simplifies their argument and allows them to talk about one thing at a time and extrapolate useful patterns. However, the real world does not exist in an economic vacuum. The way our political system works today greatly influences the economic realities in our country. Today’s Mega-corporations control vast amount of capital that can be used to fund lobbies that can greatly influence policy regarding antitrust laws, hiring practices and other such political-economic decisions. Thus, the political power of corporations can lead to artificially lower wages and higher prices than would be the case in a fully free market.\n\nIn an otherwise free market, labor unions typically cause artificially high wages, causing higher unemployment across each unionized industry. This means that those worker who would have had jobs in the industry at a lower pay rate move to other industries which they are not as well suited. Since they are not well suited to their second choice job, they are contributing to the economy as much as they otherwise would. Therefore, in a truly free market labor unions are unnecessary and counter productive.\n\nHowever, with the power large employers can gain in our political world, the price of labor is already lower than it would otherwise be in a free market. Thus, there are two possible solutions to this problem: (1.) raise the wages of laborers to their natural level by restructuring the political system through campaign finance laws and lobbying reform or (2.) by allowing workers to organize and negotiate high wages as a unit. Clearly, given the existing political power already realized by corporate America, the former solution wold be difficult and timely. In the later solution, labor can be organized without the explicit help of the political system.

Do what the bible says you shouldn''t… Who has more to lose?\n>\n> ...\n\nI hear this argument quite a bit, so I decided to take a minute to respond. Here is what I responded:\n\nI find that sort of “Insurance” based belief to be a bit misleading. It works great if there are only two possibilities (Christianity or Nothing). But that isn''t the case. Wikipeida''s world religions category contains over 75 different entries, not including those in sub categories. Thus, in a purely statistical sense, by choosing Christianity, you have only a 1 in 76 chance in choosing correctly!\n\nIf your goal is to choose the spiritual path that will most likely help you avoid pain and suffering, you may want to look a Buddhism. Buddhism centers around focus on the present moment, and accepting what is, be it happiness suffering or whatever. Thus, the external world means little to the Buddhist. There are even Monks in Tibet who have gotten so good at being in touch with their inner energy, that they can turn off their sense of physical pain. (This is not conjecture, myth or just a story. Actual western scientists have researched this and have verified using brain scans etc, that they in fact do not feel pain unless they choose to). Thus, if the Buddhist is wrong, and a literal Jewish/Christian view is correct, I doubt it would matter in the slightest to the Buddhist if he were tortured in the depths of firey hell. He is no longer connected with physical and emotional pain, and can endure Satan’s torture as easily as you or I could tolerate a food we do not enjoy.\n\n\nNow of course, this is pretty ridiculous. I’m not telling you to convert or anything. I am just saying that this sort of argument you''ve presented doesn''t quite hold up. If you believe in Christianity, have faith from the depths of your heart – not as a fail\-safe against suffering in the afterlife.','\n',char(10)),'2006-10-24 00:00:00','An examination of the flawed notion of religion as ''insurance.''

Seeing this, I thought it would be prudent to honor it by reading up on Islamic Mysticism, as seen by the Sufis. So I picked up The Way of the Sufi (Penguin Arkana).\n\n\nAlthough the book was a valuable read, and at times very inthrawling, it was also quite difficult to proccess. Part of Sufism states that the right spiritual path is dependent on time and location. Thus, teachings that apply to one locality at one time, do not apply in another time or place. Therefore I was reading something that was telling me again and again that it was not applicable to me. \n\n\nAlthough it was frustrating, I found the Sufis did (do) exhibit quite a bit of true wisdom. Their general philosophy of education as described above is actually quite intriguing in and of itself. It reminds me that applying ancient texts like the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, Homer’s works, the Koran etc. Are never going to be as applicable as they were to the contemporaries of those works. I would argue, as I believe the Sufi’s certainly would that such ancient texts are not devoid of meaning outside their original contexts, just that they should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\nThe Sufis also make extensive use of parable and poetry, often meant to misdirect the reader/student to learn something he doesn’t necessarily expect or even desire, while at the same time something that student **needs** to learn. This principle is well illustrated in a story I’ll attempt to paraphrase:\n\n\n**The Happiest Man in the World**\n\n\nA young man went to a Sufi teacher and asked him, “What do I need to do to attain true happiness? ”. The master responded that the questioner should seek out the happiest man in the world and ask for his shirt. Thus he would attain true happiness. \n\n\nEager to find the answer, the young man packed his bags and went on a journey to find the happiest man in the world. As he arrived in a new town, he asked the townsfolk who was the happiest person they knew. Each time he would meet someone, they always said “I know of a man who is much happier than I. He lives in such and such a place; seek him out”. For 40 years the man searched the world from town to town, from country, seeking ever happier and happier men.\n\n\nFinally, the man’s tiring travels led him to a very old man, living alone atop a high mountain. Exhausted he asked the old man: “Are you the happiest man in the world?” The old man, smiled and replied that he could not think of anyone who was happier than he. Relived that he had reached the end of Journey and was near attainment of what he had sought all these many years he asked the old one, “Please, I was instructed to ask for your shirt so that I may be as happy as you are”, the man requested, “May I please have your shirt?”\n\n\nAt the question, the old man laughed a large and hearty laugh saying, “I’m sorry son, but I do not have a shirt. Can you not see that my chest is bare?”\n\n\nPuzzled, the younger man studied elder. Not only was he not wearing a shirt but looking under the old one’s long beard and wrinkled, leather\-like skin was the face of the the Sufi teacher who first sent him on the quest. “Why!, Why”, the man cried, “why did you send me on this quest, when I had known you all those years ago?”\n\n\nThe old man smiled a wide grin and said, “Because that is what you needed at the time. Now you are ready to learn”.','\n',char(10)),'2006-10-23 00:00:00','An exploration of Sufism''s wisdom, highlighting the journey to understanding happiness through paradox and the importance of context in ancient teachings.');

During such a period, I’ll focus nearly all of my energy in learning everything I can about that particular topic. I don’t choose these periods, it just kind of happens that way. \n\n\nThis blog was started when my interest was focused on Spirituality. During the time this blog was broken, I became interested in, and later became bored with three to five months later:\n\n\n* Board Games – I played classic games like Mille Bornes, Othello, Cribbage and Dominoes as well as newer “German style” board games like Lost Cities. Julia (my wife) shared this interest with me. In February we went to Genghis Con, a big Gaming Convention here in Colorado and had a lot of fun. Julia was disappointed when I lost interest in board games, but I suspect I’ll come back to this one soon.\n\n\n* Entrepreneurship – If I could be paid to read about running a business, I’d be a happy man. (That isn’t to say I’m not happy as it is). Unfortunately, I tend to get really lazy when it comes to actually running a business. However, I went through a period this year where I read a ton of business books, fully intent on starting my own (non\-Consulting) business. I read classics, as well as books and blogs on “Information Marketing”, running a software business etc. I had several ideas, but none of them really panned out. Looking back, its clear I was looking for a “get rich quick” plan, which I now realize can’t really work. The last book I read in this vein was “The Millionaire Next Door” which totally changed my perspective on the whole “get rich” issue and led to my next topic of interest …\n\n\n* Personal Financial Management – After reading Thomas Stanley’s “The Millionaire Mind” I realized that I could get ‘rich’, without taking a bunch of risk, and without even doing a bunch of extra work. The key is this: Live on less than you make. Simply by going out to eat less, and visiting libraries instead of bookstores etc. I realized we could become wealthy, by Tom Stanley’s definition in about four years, much sooner than I’d ever thought possible before. Around the same time, I found Dave Ramsey, the host of a radio talk show on personal finance. In line with Stanley he advocates a detailed plan that involves paying off all consumer debt, building up a big emergency fund, then putting 15% of ones income to\-wards retirement, then paying off one’s house ASAP. We are essentially on this plan. Using it, we’ve paid off our car, some credit card debt, and raised an emergency fund that will cover me being unemployed for up to 6 months should I lose my job. Although I’ve stopped reading on this topic, we still live on a budget. We still plan on having our house paid off in a little over 3 years from now!\n\n\n* Programming – This is a recurring obsession that I’ve based my career on. This time I’m most interested in Artificial Intellegence related stuff.\n\n\n* Mathematics and Movies – I’m now interested in these two topics. I’ll write more on these in future posts.\n\n\nSo, this blog will be a bit disjointed.

What he may not realize is that perhaps that openness is part of the human race’s spiritual argument. Yes, Dogmatic, closed, judgemental religion probably isn’t good for society.

I’ll quote some of them here and give my thoughts.\n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n> The Tao is like a well:\n>\n> used but never used up.\n>\n> It is like the eternal void:\n>\n> filled with infinite possibilities.\n> It is hidden but always present.\n>\n> I don’t know who gave birth to it.\n>\n> It is older than God.\n\nIn this chapter, the Tao reminds me of the ideal code behind a software application. Its code can be used again and again, as many times as needed. It’s objects and classes can be used in infinite combinations, making for very flexible software. The users can’t see the code, and may not even know its there, but it is.\n\nThe last two lines are a little harder to fit into this perspective. Perhaps this is referring to some of the old BASIC and FORTRAN programs my grandfather wrote in the 70’s and 80’s ~~\- Powerful and flexible for their time, yet impossible to maintain :~~)\n\n\n**Chapter 63**\n\n> Act without doing;\n>\n> work without effort.\n>\n> Think of the small as large\n>\n> and the few as many.\n>\n> Confront the difficult\n>\n> while it is still easy;\n>\n> accomplish the great task\n>\n> by a series of small acts.\n>\n> The Master never reaches for the great;\n>\n> thus she achieves greatness.\n>\n> When she runs into a difficulty,\n>\n> she stops and gives herself to it.\n>\n> She doesn’t cling to her own comfort;\n>\n> thus problems are no problem for her.\n\nThis chapter describes the ideal attitude for a programmer.
