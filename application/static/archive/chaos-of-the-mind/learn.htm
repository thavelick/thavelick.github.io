<p><a name="resu"></a>Standardized tests are used for more than
simply comparing schools and students. Many supporters of
standardized tests argue that tests help kids learn, and the
results help their teachers teach. They do not. Standardized
tests do not help teachers teach, nor do they help students
learn. Only tests scores are returned to teachers after tests are
taken. Some tests return a brief description of what very general
area students are deficient in (<a href="works.htm#deli">Delisle</a>).
It denies the instructor the ability to truly find out why his
students do not perform well on the test. Professor of Education,
James R. Delisle says that the score does not help the teacher
create lesson plans to help out students who did not do well on
the test.</p>
<p><a name="curr"></a>Often, standardized tests do not test
current concepts taught in schools. Most standardized tests test
concepts that are no longer being taught. After creating
questions for a test, a testing company must norm a test. This is
a complex statistical analysis that must be done in order to
"standardize" a test. Most of the time this takes
between five to eight years (<a href="works.htm#perr">Perrone 22</a>).
Entailing this time, the time used to write the actual questions,
and financial constraints, a testing company publishes a test
approximately every eight years. This means that a test taken
today could have been created using 1989 concepts!. This would
mean that students would be tested on decade old concepts, while
being taught current concepts. This would obviously make for
inaccurately low test scores</p>
<p><a name="lcd"></a>In his <a href="works.htm#clin">speech on
education reform</a>, Bill Clinton urged over and over that a
national standardized test would help students aim for higher
standards, and thereby do better in school. What Clinton failed
to see is that, in testing only very basic skills, standardized
tests cater to a lowest common denominator, i.e. they test only
the minimum of what is acceptable (<a href="works.htm#deli">Delisle</a>).
Only a third of the California Achievement Test actually tests
advanced thinking skills. The rest of the test focuses on low
level ideas such as arithmetic and capitalization (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). Standardized tests do not help
children achieve more. They simply test what is adequate. They
lack concepts that will help students achieve more.</p>
