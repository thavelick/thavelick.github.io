<b>My Gaming Philosiphy</b></h3>
<i>I'm a big fan of Games all around. But mainly, I love computer and video
games. Of ALL genre's, well with the exception of maybe sports games. So,
upon this page you'll find all of the online game mags, and links to some
of the games I like.</i>
<p><i>NOTE: Here is my policy on software piracy. If you can go down to
a store, or order a game through the internet or other means I will NOT
pirate it. But if a game is no longer sold or manufactured, I will usually
be willing to give out or take a copy of it.</i>
<p><i>Also, I hate most shareware. Anything that will cease to work after
30 days or so is a bad product. I don't believe this should be done. Some
of us cant afford to buy or regester all our Shareware, and having your
program stop working will not get anyone to send them money. The kind of
shareware I do like is that by <a href="http://www.epicgames.com">Epic
MegaGames</a> and <a href="http://www.apogee1.com">Apogee Software</a>.
These company's give you a part of thier game, and if you like it you can
buy more. This way, you can see if you truly like a game, and If its worth
your money.</i>
<p><i>Ok there's my two cents. On to the Games!!!!!!!!!!!!</i>

<h3>
<b>Online Game Magazines</b></h3>
<i>This area used to be filled with Game Magazine Links.  I thought
I had almost every online game in existence.  Well, guess what? 
I was worng quite wrong in fact.  I recently surfed over to yahoo,
and looked at their game magazine page.  There must have been 75 of
them.  95% of them were absolute 10-day old dog crap.  So, I
decided that, maybe I should just put cool magazine links on my page. 
What an idea., so here ya go:</i>
<br/><i></i> 
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http://www.allgames.com">The AllGames Network - www.allgames.com</a> -  This
has got to be the most awsome game site in the world, each day they feature
an interview with someone in the gaming industry.  The interviews
are in a RealAudio Stream, so no bothersome waiting for downloads  
Also has a huge demo archive  If you are going to die in the next
24 hours, forget saying goodbye to the family, dad and the guys down at
the bar   Spend your remaining moments at allgames.com</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://www.cdmag.com"> Computer Games and Stradegy Plus Online - www.cdmag.com </a>
- This is one of the best, least graphics intensive sites I've ever been
to.  They update their articles on a daily basis, and they have, nice,
long reviews and strategies.  cdmag's writers have a witty, almost
sarcastic writing still that makes their mag a joy to read.  If you
are thinking of buying a game, cruise over to cdmag and read the review. 
It could be the most important link you ever click</li>

<h3>
<b>Cool Games and Thier Companies</b></h3>
Here are some of my favorite games, and the companies:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.LucasArts.com">LucasArts</a> - Makers of all those
GREAT Star Wars games, incuding Rebel Assault 2 (As good as the movies!),
and Dark Forces. LucasArts also made, my favorite non-strategy game, Maniac
Mansion 2: Dat of the Tentacle. I picked this game up at a computer swap
for $3 and I've played it at least 5 times, and I still laugh while playing
it. If you like the King Quest series, you'll LOVE Dott.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.microprose.com">MicroProse</a> - They Produce some
of the best startegy games, Including Civilization and Master of Orion.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">Id Software</a> - I used to hate DOOM,
until I got a level editor and an IPX network. WOW!!! Look soon for some
of Imperial Software's awsome Deathmatch WADs (someday)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.squaresoft.com&gt;SquareSoft&lt;/A&gt; - Producers of the most high quality RPG's in the world today. 
I may just have to buy myself a PSX to Final Fantasy VII.&lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;A HREF=" http:="" www.blizzard.com"="">Blizzard</a> - Every game these guys have put out has been a fun, high quality
game in every aspect.  I own every game they have produced to date,
and I dont regret it for a second.</li>
<li>
<u>Microsoft</u> - wait... no.... Microsoft games SUCK! (hear that? That's
the sound of no one arguing.)</li>
