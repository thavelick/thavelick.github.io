<h3 align="left">rogue</h3>
<p align="left">This probably the first game to start an entire
genre of games. This was probably the first computer-based RPG.
Before rogue people spent thier time entertaining themsevles with
Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and perhaps a few college students and
businessmen had access to <u>Adventure</u> the first
text-adventure.</p>
<p align="left">But rogue, originally for Unix-based computers
revalutionized computer games. Although it still had character
based graphics, it was still a very immersive game for its time.
When I first booted the game up I thought, "What a piece of
crap! What was my friend thinking!" But then I realized i'd
been playing it for almost 2 and a half hours. Although crude,
rogue is a great realtime overhead RPG that many people still
play today. Without it we may never have seen Zelda or Final
Fantasy.</p>
