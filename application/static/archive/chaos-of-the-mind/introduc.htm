<p><a name="remb"></a>A student sits uncomfortably in his desk.
Silence surrounds him. He nervously grasps his number two pencil.
He glances to the clock. Time is running out. He knows he could
answer this problem if he had time to solve it, but he does not.
Frustrated he quickly leans forward and fills in a random circle.
Three months later he receives the results to his test. All he
hears is a number, if anything. Unlike the tests his teacher
normally gives, he cannot go back and see what he did wrong. The
score is not the greatest, but he does not care. He ignores it
thinking, &quot;At least it's not for a grade. It doesn't
matter&quot;. I remember countless situations like these
unfolding in front of me. They are anything but pleasant
experiences, yet millions of kids around the country go through
this every day while undertaking standardized tests.</p>

<p><a name="hist"></a>The idea behind standardized testing came
about in the early twentieth century. Such tests were the results
of the &quot;school efficiency movement&quot;. The original idea
came from Franklin Bobbit, who applied Fredrick Taylor's factory
management principals to schools. This idea attempted to convert
intellectual standards to numbers. These numbers were created not
to help students, but to impress parents and businessmen (<a
href="works.htm#wigg">Wiggins 705</a>). For years standardized
tests such as the ACT and SAT have been used to help determine
what students may enter what colleges. Recently, the amount of
standardized testing that is done has greatly increased. Almost
every school district in the nation. Over 100 million tests are
given every year. This costs the nation an average of $700
million to $900 million annually (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>).
Today politicians in Washington DC are debating a national
standardized testing program (<a href="works.htm#kirc">Kirchoff</a>).
In Russia, Germany, and Japan, a single test determines how far a
student can go in school.</p>

<p><a name="arg"></a>With all this standardized testing around
us, one might think that standardized tests work well and they
should be continued. This is completely untrue. Standardized
testing should not be a weighing factor in student assessment.
They are not an accurate measure of student knowledge. Also,
incentive programs based on standardized tests do not help
schools do better. In addition, they hinder rather than help
students learn. Overall, standardized testing should not be used
to assess student performance, nor should they be used as
incentives for schools and students to do better.</p>
