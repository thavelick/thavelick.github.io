True, I can't go down to cherry creek mall and buy the most expensive watch they have, but I've never had much of a taste for luxury anyhow.  I can however, head down to the music store and buy any CD I want.  Had I the inclination, I could visit Best Buy and purchase any DVD I wanted.  The same can be said about a visit to Tattered Cover, my local bookshop and obtain a copy of anything I desired to read.    In any case, I could probably get away with doing these things quite often.</p>\n<p>The preceding paragraph was not written out of a desire to brag.  The fact is, with very little determination and the ability to bend (okay break) a little copyright law, or dare I say, visit your local library you too can have similar ability even when living hand to mouth.</p>\n<p>Strange as it may seem, given the ability to own all this media and physical goods, I have recently come to procure less and less of it.  In most cases if I want to watch a movie, I'll Tivo it, or watch it on Netflix.  If I want to listen to music, more often than not in the pas t few months, I'll visit Pandora.  Truth be told, prior to my reunion with Pandora I'd pirated a lot of music, but that activity has greatly slowed recently. Whenever I do want to listen to specific music, I'll acquire it digitally, or at the very least get a CD and immediately rip it to digital format, with the CD itself rarely to be seen again.   I also very rarely buy physical books these days. Unless I'm reading something obscure, I almost always read on my Kindle.</p>\n<p>Yet, as I look around my apartment I see shelf after shelf of movies I like, but rarely watch.  I see bookshelves filled so much that books are stacked in front of other books.  The phenomenon continues as I look to my kitchen, filled with gadgets rarely used, and cookbooks rarely opened.</p>\n<p>Julia (my wife) and I spent a lot of time today clearing things out and getting rid of a lot of junk we've acquired over the years, and although we have a lot to go, it finally feels more than just clean-- Itt has some semblance of being organized.  And yet, a sense of foreboding comes over me as  the day after christmas approaches.</p>\n<p>Despite my being an atheist, christmas is by far my favorite holiday.  I love spending time with family, eating, drinking and talking. I love the spirit of giving and honest camaraderie.  I love to see  the expressions on everyone's faces when they get something they really wanted.  I even really love the feeling I get when I myself open a really creative and unique gift I hadn't even thought of buying myself, or that one thing I was really hoping for.</p>\n<p>That said, I have in some ways come to dread the day after christmas. When I come home, much of the revelry has passed and I have got a brand new batch of stuff to layer atop my existing possessions.  Its not that I don't like them, its that I really hate storing them.  I live in a small condo and really don't want to \"upgrade\"my housing just to accommodate more stuff.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I've come to realize of late that I get much more enjoyment out of doing things than having things.  I really enjoyed the last couple books I read, but I enjoy discussing such books with people almost more than reading.  I enjoy listening to music, but I most enjoy hearing new music a friend recommended, or going to a concert (either classical or rock).  Overall, I've found that more happiness comes from gaining memories rather than possessions.  I've even seen a lot of research to back up that proposition.  On that note, I have the following suggestions to gift givers out there:</p>\n<pre><code>* If you're going to give some kind of media give the digital kind, if the recipient is like me and is so inclined.\n* Instead of giving someone an art book, offer to visit your favorite museum with them, or buy them a membership.\n* Instead of giving someone a DVD, buy them some movie tickets and offer to join them.\n* In lieu of a CD, offer to take someone to a concert, play, musical, or symphony.\n* Rather than giving a cookbook or gadget, invite your recipient over to cook something with you or clip a few of your own favorite recipes.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sure, there are many out there who like getting stuff for christmas. I know when I was younger and had a severe shortage of stuff, I would have been disappointed if my christmas consisted of things from the above list. Also, many times a physical gift really is best. If  you are endowed with amazing talent at creating or finding unique gifts, keep it up.  A place can always be found for something truly heartfelt or amazing.  But if your christmas shopping typically consists of a visit to the mall, best buy, or a web superstore, and you can't figure out what to give to your Wookie friend when he already owns too many combs (see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSWCQ7ALEms\">this video</a>) , give the above list a shot.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"11 years ago","title":"Thoughts on consumer goods and christmas 2010"},"timeToRead":4}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
