    <h1>Adam Ragusea's Pizza Dough</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/4 cups (530 ml) warm water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sugar (12g) sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (9g) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (18 g) kosher salt</li>
      <li>5 cups (600g) bread flour, plus more for working the dough</li>
      <li>additional oil for greasing the dough</li>
      <li>cornmeal, semolina flour, or coarse-ground whole wheat flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start the dough by combining the water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl and let sit for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>
        If the yeast goes foamy, it's alive and you're good to proceed (if it doesn't, it's dead and you
        need new yeast). Add the olive oil and salt and 5 cups (600g) of bread flour. Mix until just
        combined, then start kneading. Add just enough additional flour to keep the dough workable
        (i.e. not too sticky) and kneed until you can stretch some of the dough into a thin sheet
        without it tearing. (NOTE: You will probably need to add a lot more flour. The quantity I give
        here is just a base line to get your started.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into four equal balls and put them in four containers (ideally glass) and
        lightly coat the balls and the interior of their containers with olive oil. Cover, and either rise at room
        temperature for two hours, or put them in the refrigerator and let them rise for 1-7 days. (I prefer the long,
        cold
        rise.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sometimes I choose the easy way and get pizza dough premade from the grocery store and that's totally okay
      </li>
    </ul>
