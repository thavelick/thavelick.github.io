*[I wrote this a couple years back in draft form and never got around to publishing it. I'm a little less enthusiastic about the "IndieWeb" revolution now, but it does serve  introduce the blog reasonably well]*

I'm joining the IndieWeb revolution by creating my own personal website again for the first time in
years! A lot of the structure comes from the venerable Derek Sivers, Is built with GatsbyJS and is
hosted on GitHub Pages.  Soon I'll be porting all of my old facebook, twitter and medium posts over
here, along with hopefully adding some new content.
