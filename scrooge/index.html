    <h1>Reasons I like Uncle Scrooge</h1>
    <h2>Nostalgia</h2>
    I started reading Uncle Scroogle comics at a time in my life whn I didn't have a lot of interests beyond computers and video games. Even though
    I don't read the comics often these days, they repersent a reminder in my life to keep my interests and horizons broad.
    <h2>I like being contrarian</h2>
    My interest in comics started around the time as my friends. But while they were getting into Superman and Spiderman I was Drawn to Disnesy comics.
    I got made fun of for reading comics for "kids", but I found the stories by Carl Barks and later others to have more depth and adventure than spiderman
    beating up a long line of baddies
    <h2>Its a metophor for what capitalism could be and an interesting counterpoint to my socialist tendancies</h2>
    Scrooge McDuck (unlike his Dickeansian counterpart) seems to have made his fortune without being too exploitive. He made his money from doing hard
    work

      When I was young, I really liked computers: programming them, reading about them,
      breaking them, fixing them, playing video games, making proto-video games, playing with
      business target software I had no real use for, BBSs and more. If it was on a keyboard
      attached to a TV or monitor I loved it.

      By the time I was 13, as my seen through my parent's eyes, was that I liked little else.
      My Legos were gathering dust. My toys were discarded and sold at garage sales. I'd
      occasionally read a book but not as veraciously as my parents did at my age, nor as
      much as my older sibling. My mom broke it to me: if I didn't come up with some
      additional things to do with my time I would face a terrible fate. I would
      grow up to become boring!

      Taking this fear to heart, I set out to find a hobby. Sports? Even wheelchair basketball
      didn't hold any appeal. Stamp collecting? Why would I spend my money on something that's
      just going to sit on a shelf?
