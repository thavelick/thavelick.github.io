					<description>Interestingly enough this is a very similar set of obssesions that I have been going through - tho maybe a few months after yourself.

I also have an investigate 9/11 hobby but that's more of an imperative than an obssesion for me.

I disagree about a Business being a get rich quick scheme tho - even "inventinve" high risk businesses can be worth persuing - as long as you also are following a Dave Ramsey-esque foundation.

The Rich Dad books really champion this two-pronged approach - and I find it more inspiring than the more iterative - "live right, save, pay your taxes" doctirne...

As long as the foundation is solid - I think one can weather a few crazy economic storms to achieve uncommon success in the business world.</description>

					<description>Hmm. Yeah, you caught me at a bad time(I was really tired). Not my link (cakes just sent me the issue)
You came in on a referer though? Not how that works.
Either way, feel free to torch both comments.</description>

					<description>Hey :-) Thanks for the mention. Sure enough, I got here by finding you in my logs.
Your blog doesn't appear to submit trackbacks though; I never got one from your site. You should really look into that.</description>

		<title>Comment on Debunking Religion as &#8220;insurance&#8221; by Mark Russell</title>

					<description>Tristan,

I agree - Pascal's wager at first glance seems a little simplistic - for exactly the reason you present.

However, I believe part of the confusion is the way people view/understand Heaven and Hell.

Hell is a place of eternal seperation from God.

Heaven is a place of eternal fellowship with God.

In the case of the above I believe a Buddhist would suffer because they would be enlightened to the reality of this situation once they found themselves in Hell.

And frustration would result as part of this enlightenment.

Now, you may ask - as many do - is this fair that a peaceful (and presumably kind) man would end up in Hell for his choice?

But I think that is a highly anthropomorphised viewpoint.

From the view of an Omnipotent creator - God simply refines his creation and removes the purified product from the dross - and takes his perfected creation to be close with him forever - in an idealized state.

And, of course, to try to understand the mind of an Omnipotent being is an exercise in futility for a limted, temporal, self-aware creature - but we can understand and choose to accept the path that he has given us to take.

I think it is important for us to decide what path we would want to take - and not to get bogged down in wondering (or judging) what path others are destined for.

I believe a comprehensive reading of Jesus's teaching in the New Testament is a good place to start investigating Christianity.

To me this parable summarizes the importance of finding a personal spiritual truth in one's life:

"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field."

 Matthew 13:44</description>

					<description>What you wrote about an enlightened Buddhist not caring about hell, was similar to what Bhante Piyananda said to a Fundamentalist who was trying to "show him the light." Piyananda said: "I'd rather go to hell, so that I could be of some help to those who are suffering." &lt;a href="http://frimmin.com/books/saffrondays.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Saffron Days in LA &lt;/a&gt;</description>

					<description>I just completed the spirituality survey.  My results seemed to be an exact duplicate of Tristan's.  

It must be something in the water in Colorado.

(This is my second try at a comment here.  The last time the system would not recognize me as human.  Maybe that has something to do with the water in Colorado too.)

OK.  Third try.</description>

					<description>Julia, I noticed the same thing with Hinduism in mine. The only reason I can think of is that Buddhist--especially Mahayana beliefs--are a little more diverse and fit easier with Western thought than Hindu beliefs.</description>

					<description>This is interesting.  I am not surprised with my second result as I grew up in the Methodist church which is a pretty liberal sect of Christianity.  I am also not surprised by my first rating as I have always wanted to try the Unitarian path.  What surprised me was that Hinuism and Buddhism weren't higher.  You would think with all of the yoga that I do and my Mom's upbringing that would be higher.  Nonetheless, here are my results.   

1.  Unitarian Universalism (100%)  
2.  Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestants (95%)  
3.  Liberal Quakers (95%)  
4.  New Age (81%)  
5.  Neo-Pagan (79%)  
6.  Mahayana Buddhism (74%)  
7.  Reform Judaism (74%)  
8.  Theravada Buddhism (70%)  
9.  New Thought (69%)  
10.  Orthodox Quaker (67%)  
11.  Hinduism (67%)  
12.  Secular Humanism (60%)  
13.  Scientology (57%)  
14.  Bahá'í Faith (55%)  
15.  Jainism (55%)  
16.  Taoism (55%)  
17.  Christian Science (Church of Christ, Scientist) (52%)  
18.  Sikhism (52%)  
19.  Seventh Day Adventist (44%)  
20.  Orthodox Judaism (41%)  
21.  Mainline to Conservative Christian/Protestant (39%)  
22.  Nontheist (34%)  
23.  Eastern Orthodox (33%)  
24.  Roman Catholic (33%)  
25.  Islam (31%)  
26.  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) (27%)  
27.  Jehovah's Witness (18%)</description>
