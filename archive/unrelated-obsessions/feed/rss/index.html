		<title>Underhanded SEO tricks</title>
		<description>I've been doing a lot of reading of late on "Black Hat SEO", which is basically search engine optimization that doesn't play by search engines rules.  This includes more grey area things, like scraping massive amounts of content from other sites, and re-optimizing with new keywords, to more nefarious ...</description>

		<title>On Obsessions</title>
		<description>If you've known me personally for a while, you'll notice that I tend to get very interested in certain topics for 4-6 month periods.  During such a period, I'll focus nearly all of my energy in learning everything I can about that particular topic.  I don't choose these ...</description>

		<title>Back Online / Concluding Spirituality</title>
		<description>I finally got some time to fix my blog this afternoon... (It had been broken for a long while).

Since I last posted, I have lost interest in spirituality reading, and thus future posts will likely be about other things.  Regarding Spirituality, I still sit in pretty much the same ...</description>

		<title>Spirituality Survey</title>
		<description>Tonight, I found this "spirituality survey":http://beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html .  Unlike some survey sites, this one is pretty unbiased and seems to have a wide variety of questions and answer choices.  Although I think there is a lot to be learned from all the world's religions, even the ones we consider ...</description>

		<title>Philosophical Questions re-emerge after seeing, The Lion King</title>
		<description>Last Friday, my family and I saw the stage adaptation of Disney's _The Lion King_.  It reminded me of an important lesson.  Of late I had taken on the philosophy of staying focused on the present moment, and not dwelling in the past or fearing the future.  ...</description>

		<title>Islamic Philosophy through Sufism</title>
		<description>Last week, when I walked into my local bookstore, they had a display paying homage to this being the Islamic Holy month of Ramadan.  Seeing this, I thought it would be prudent to honor it by reading up on Islamic Mysticism, as seen by the Sufis.   So ...</description>

		<title>The Tao Te Ching For Programmers</title>
		<description>Reading the Tao, several of it's short chapters seemed to speak to me as a programmer.  I'll quote some of them here and give my thoughts.

*Chapter 4*

The Tao is like a well:
used but never used up.
It is like the eternal void:
filled with infinite possibilities.


It is hidden but always present.
