<h3 align="center">The Conclusion</h3>

<hr>

<p>The inaccuracy of standardized tests makes them an unreliable
means to test and compare students. The ability for students and
teachers to easily cheat makes the reliability of standardized
tests even lower. Standardized tests do not help students learn,
nor do they help teachers teach better. The amount of time spent
on standardized tests hinders the time students have to learn.
There are alternatives to standardized testing that work better.
Overall, standardized tests should not be used as much as they
are. Education is one of the prime concerns of the coming
millennium, as it should be. But if we keep making conclusions
based on an inaccurate, overly time-consuming measure of
assessment, the road to the future may come to a dead end.
Standardized tests are a wrong turn for education reform. Let's
turn around and get back on course to a better tomorrow.</p>
