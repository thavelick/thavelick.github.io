    <h1>My Web Archive</h1>
    <p>
      There are several websites I created that have died and been saved
      by archive.org or oocitties.org. I've recovered them here.

    <h2>Chaos of the Mind</h2>
    This was one of my first websites, created around 1996 and maintained
    until sometime in 1998. Some interesting pages:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="chaos-of-the-mind/index.htm">The Main Page</a></li>
      <li>
        <a href="chaos-of-the-mind/imperial.htm">Imperial Software</a>
        - A page for a game I created around this time
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="chaos-of-the-mind/rpg.htm">The Classic RPG database</a>
        - A list of rpg games for 80s and 90s game systems. I rebuilt
        this as a proper database years later, but this one is arguably
        cooler
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="chaos-of-the-mind/egg.htm">How to Make Ukrainian Easter Eggs</a>
        - I built this little site instructing on how to make Ukrainian
        Easter Eggs as part of Russian class in high school. Sadly the
        Ingredients page is missing due to a linking error, but who knows
        maybe someone will find it useful.
      </li>
