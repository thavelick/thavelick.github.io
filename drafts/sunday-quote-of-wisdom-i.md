> On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow. – **Nietzsche**







Whether in science or in spirit, this rings ture. So long as we keep an open mind and keep pressing forward, we come closer to truth.

Note that the Sunday Quote of Wisdom is a shameless ripoff of my sister’s [Friday Fractal](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230041145/http://scienceblogs.com/chaoticutopia/2006/10/friday_fractal_xxi.php) at her blog, [Chaotic Utopia](https://web.archive.org/web/20110101181627/http://scienceblogs.com/chaoticutopia).
