I’ve just finsihed my second, slower read of Lau Tzu’s Tao Te Ching as translated by Stephen Mitchell. While pondering this short but rich (as in cheesecake) book, I thought of many things that would make great blog entries. I couldn’t decide on just one, so here is a preview of blog posts to come regarding and/or inspired by this ancient writing:


  



* [The Tao Te Ching for programmers](http://www.tristanhavelick.com/the-tao-te-ching-for-programmers/) (Not to be confused with the Tao of Programming)
* A time for this and a time for that – One stanza of the Tao Te Ching that seems strangely similar to a book of the bible (and, by proxy a classic rock song)
* Is there a role for the “enlightend” in Politics?
* Lao Tzu – Adam Smith from 500 BC?
* A Quick Summary of the Tao – Not what you expect.


Meanwhile, I’ll be starting on my next book. It’s back to the western world for a while with Holy Silence: The Gift Of Quaker Spirituality
