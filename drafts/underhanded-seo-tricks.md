I’ve been doing a lot of reading of late on “Black Hat SEO”, which is basically search engine optimization that doesn’t play by search engines rules. This includes more grey area things, like scraping massive amounts of content from other sites, and re\-optimizing with new keywords, to more nefarious things like blog spam. A lot of things these Black Hats are just plain creative. One such thing is the using a forged referrer back to your website on all websites you visit. ( See [Fake Your Referer, Get More Traffic](https://web.archive.org/web/20190402172825/http://www.nickycakes.com/fake-your-referer-get-more-traffic/)  ) I’m testing this now, so if you got here by finding my site in your logs, let me know!
