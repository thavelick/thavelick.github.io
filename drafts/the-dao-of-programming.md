If anyone happens to look at my “Currently reading” list on the left, you’ll see I’m reading the “Tao Te Ching”. If you are are programmer, you can get a shorter, and more specialized work based on it, [The Tao of Programming](http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html)


It’s hilarious in that “funny because its true” way.
