I finally got some time to fix my blog this afternoonâ€¦ (It had been broken for a long while).


Since I last posted, I have lost interest in spirituality reading, and thus future posts will likely be about other things. Regarding Spirituality, I still sit in pretty much the same boat I started in: I see myself as an open\-minded agnostic, respecting (nearly) all spiritual disciplines for their wisdom.
