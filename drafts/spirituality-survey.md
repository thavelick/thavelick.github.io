Tonight, I found this spirituality survey. Unlike some survey sites, this one is pretty unbiased and seems to have a wide variety of questions and answer choices. Although I think there is a lot to be learned from all the world’s religions, even the ones we consider “Mythology” now, it seems to have pegged my current spiritual state pretty well. Here are my results. How did you (my 1.2 regular readers out there) do? How does it compare with what you *think* you believe?
