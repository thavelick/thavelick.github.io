    <h1>Games I've made</h1>
    <p>I like programming games and have done so in some form since I was a kid. In recent years
    I've enjoyed participating in weekend game jams with friends. This page lists every reasonably
    complete game I've worked on including some from my childhood that have been lost to time.</p>

    <h2>The Mid-to-Late 1990s</h2>
    <p>
        In the 90s I attempted to make a great many games with my good friend Erik.
        Most of them suffered from lots of scope creep and being a bit over
        my head in terms of programming effort at the time. Erik and I still
        work together making games for game jams with bitDecayGames.

        <li>
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010602133134/http://www.havelick.com/imperial/">
                Face Race
            </a> - A cartoon themed version of the game nim. Drop all of
            your faces into a pit and listen to them scream. If you drop the last
            one, you lose!. Complete with a poorly coded computer player. The 
            source code to this one has been lost but the windows 3.1 binaries
            still exist thanks to the Wayback Machine. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Toon Attack - You are a rabbit and aliens have come to attack the
            forest you live in. Defend the tress from the alien probes with your
            carrot cannon before the alien can destroy all of them! This game's
            binaries and visual basic source have been lost, but you can play
            the version I remade (badly) in 2021.
        </li>
        <li>
            Space Master - A classic vertical space shooter. Destroy the
            Meteors and Enemy Ships before they destroy you. This was the first
            PC game we made. Sadly it's binaries and source have been lost.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Late 1980s and Early 1990s</h2>
    <p>
    In this period I was learning programming on an Atari 800 XL and Atari ST.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Bricks - A simple Breakout clone I made for the Atari ST in Hi-Soft 
          Basic. It was the first game I made that wasn't just an example from a book. Backups
          weren't even a thing I knew you could do at the time, so this was
          destined to be lost.
      </li>
      <li>
          Guess My Number - This is the first interactive program I can recall
          making. It was just a console game in Atari Basic that asked you to
          guess a random number between 1 and 100. It would loop, telling
          you weather the target number was higher or lower.
