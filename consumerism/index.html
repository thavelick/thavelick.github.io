<h1>Thoughts on consumer goods and Christmas 2010</h1>
<p><em>[This article originally appeared on Blog Spot and was
published here on 2020-11-22]</em></p>
<p>In recent months I've come to realization that I can buy pretty
much any consumer good I really want. True, I can't go down to
cherry creek mall and buy the most expensive watch they have, but
I've never had much of a taste for luxury anyhow. I can however,
head down to the music store and buy any CD I want. Had I the
inclination, I could visit Best Buy and purchase any DVD I wanted.
The same can be said about a visit to Tattered Cover, my local
bookshop and obtain a copy of anything I desired to read. In any
case, I could probably get away with doing these things quite
often.</p>
<p>The preceding paragraph was not written out of a desire to brag.
The fact is, with very little determination and the ability to bend
(okay break) a little copyright law, or dare I say, visit your
local library you too can have similar ability even when living
hand to mouth.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, given the ability to own all this media
and physical goods, I have recently come to procure less and less
of it. In most cases if I want to watch a movie, I'll Tivo it, or
watch it on Netflix. If I want to listen to music, more often than
not in the pas t few months, I'll visit Pandora. Truth be told,
prior to my reunion with Pandora I'd pirated a lot of music, but
that activity has greatly slowed recently. Whenever I do want to
listen to specific music, I'll acquire it digitally, or at the very
least get a CD and immediately rip it to digital format, with the
CD itself rarely to be seen again. I also very rarely buy physical
books these days. Unless I'm reading something obscure, I almost
always read on my Kindle.</p>
<p>Yet, as I look around my apartment I see shelf after shelf of
movies I like, but rarely watch. I see bookshelves filled so much
that books are stacked in front of other books. The phenomenon
continues as I look to my kitchen, filled with gadgets rarely used,
and cookbooks rarely opened.</p>
<p>Julia (my wife) and I spent a lot of time today clearing things
out and getting rid of a lot of junk we've acquired over the years,
and although we have a lot to go, it finally feels more than just
clean-- It has some semblance of being organized. And yet, a sense
of foreboding comes over me as the day after Christmas
approaches.</p>
<p>Despite my being an atheist, Christmas is by far my favorite
holiday. I love spending time with family, eating, drinking and
talking. I love the spirit of giving and honest camaraderie. I love
to see the expressions on everyone's faces when they get something
they really wanted. I even really love the feeling I get when I
myself open a really creative and unique gift I hadn't even thought
of buying myself, or that one thing I was really hoping for.</p>
<p>That said, I have in some ways come to dread the day after
christmas. When I come home, much of the revelry has passed and I
have got a brand new batch of stuff to layer atop my existing
possessions. Its not that I don't like them, its that I really hate
storing them. I live in a small condo and really don't want to
"upgrade"my housing just to accommodate more stuff.</p>
<p>At the same time, I've come to realize of late that I get much
more enjoyment out of doing things than having things. I really
enjoyed the last couple books I read, but I enjoy discussing such
books with people almost more than reading. I enjoy listening to
music, but I most enjoy hearing new music a friend recommended, or
going to a concert (either classical or rock). Overall, I've found
that more happiness comes from gaining memories rather than
possessions. I've even seen a lot of research to back up that
proposition. On that note, I have the following suggestions to gift
givers out there:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you're going to give some kind of media give the digital kind, if the recipient is like me and is so inclined.</li>
  <li>Instead of giving someone an art book, offer to visit your favorite museum with them, or buy them a membership.</li>
  <li>Instead of giving someone a DVD, buy them some movie tickets and offer to join them.</li>
  <li>In lieu of a CD, offer to take someone to a concert, play, musical, or symphony.</li>
  <li>Rather than giving a cookbook or gadget, invite your recipient over to cook something with you or clip a few of your own favorite recipes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, there are many out there who like getting stuff for
Christmas. I know when I was younger and had a severe shortage of
stuff, I would have been disappointed if my Christmas consisted of
things from the above list. Also, many times a physical gift really
is best. If you are endowed with amazing talent at creating or
finding unique gifts, keep it up. A place can always be found for
something truly heartfelt or amazing. But if your Christmas
shopping typically consists of a visit to the mall, best buy, or a
web superstore, and you can't figure out what to give to your
Wookie friend when he already owns too many combs (see <a href=

give the above list a shot.</p>
