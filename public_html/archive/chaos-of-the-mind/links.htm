<p align="left">Here, I list the pages that I fear most, because
of thie similarity to mine. These sites are the ones that will
keep me impoving my site, to stay in the race. Please visit them
because they are all very useful, and all have some information I
do not.</p>

<p>The RPG Encyclopedia. This guy has the same ultimate goal as
me, but he has a diffrent apporach to achieving it. I am working
towards my goal, by creating a big list of every RPG in
exsitance, then going back and adding detail, wheres the
Encyclopedia focuses on detail first, and quanity later. It is
very promising, nevertheless. Of course, I DID want that adress.
Oh well.</p>

<h3><a
href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Horizon/7480/">Age
of Mystics</a></h3>

<p>This page is awsome. It covers virtually ever RPG ever made
for the PC. Although I hadn't been to this page before I started
Classic RPG's, I feel that my site should have similar content as
Age of Mystics in it's future. (the consle equivilent there-of,
of course. The only problem with this page is it lacks great web
design, but hey, what more important design or content</p>
