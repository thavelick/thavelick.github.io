<h2 align="center">Sega Game Gear</h2>

<p align="left">The GameGear is a portable, color gaming system.
It had a hugh hardware advantage over its competion, the Nintendo
Gameboy (Unlike all its other systems). But, I think this made
Sega get cocky. There just doesn't seem to be as many cool games
for GameGear as there are for Gameboy. But hey, at least I can
see the screen at night.</p>

<p>* These Games came from a VERY unreliable source. As he did
not have roms for them, I have never played them. If you are
framiliar with these games please <a
href="mailto:thavelick@usa.net">e-mail me</a> confirming if they
are in fact RPGs, and what their style and genre they are.</p>

<p>Also, any help filling in ? marks would help me greatly. Just <a
