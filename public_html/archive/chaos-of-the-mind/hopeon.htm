<p align="left"><a name="pref"></a>One way to test students using
a method besides standardized tests is using performance testing.
While undergoing performance testing, students simply do what is
being tested. If a student's writing ability were to be tested,
he would simply write an essay, pertaining to a concrete set of
guidelines, graded by a team of teachers from various schools (<a
href="works.htm#olds">Olds</a>). Although this method is not as
black and white as standardized testing, it works. If a student
cannot write, he will not be able to write a passing essay. The
student will learn as he does a performance test. With
performance testing the teacher is given an accurate picture of
how well each student can perform, and he can use that test to
help decide where he needs to go next with his students. (<a
href="works.htm#olds">Olds</a>). It does not limit his ability to
push his students' limits.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="card"></a>Some believe that standardized
tests are the only way for students to have an incentive to do
better. However, in Harrison school district, &quot;a color-coded
Honor Card is granted to upper-level students who receive all A's
and B's during a grading period. The card is good for 10 percent
discounts at more than 100 local stores and restaurants&quot; (<a
href="works.htm#spee">Speer</a>). A similar card program has been
instated at Standley Lake High School, in Colorado. Schools could
use the some of the money commonly used on standardized tests to
create programs similar to Harrison's honor card program. </p>

<p align="left"><a name="coll"></a>Colleges have often relied
heavily on standardized test scores to help decide what students
are admitted to their schools. But, many colleges rely more
heavily on factors such as class rank, admissions essays, and
difficulty of classes taken to determine who goes to their
colleges. Other alternatives to standardized testing do exist..</p>
