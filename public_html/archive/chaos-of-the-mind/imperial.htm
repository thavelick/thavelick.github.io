<I>Imperial Software</I> is a little "company" I started up with, Erik, my best friend.  At the moment we only have one measly game that realy kinda sucks, people seem to get a kick out of it.  The sound is pretty cool, and I worked pretty hard on the SI (Synthetic Intelegence).  So, we would realy apreciate it if you downloaded, <A HREF="facrac23.zip"> Face Race 2.3</A>, for Windows 3.1.  You need the following to run it:
<UL>
<LI>Windows 3.1 or Windows 95
<LI>the file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.apexsc.com/pub/cgvb/misc/VBRUN200.EXE">VBRUN200.DLL </A> (Uncompress and copy to your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ directory) 
<LI><A HREF="mcivbx.zip">MCI.VBX </A>(Uncompress and copy to your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ directory) 
<LI>a mouse (no not a rat)
<LI>and a Sound Card (optional but highly recomended)
</UL></H4>
<P>
We will have a much better game out very soon, but I just haven't gotten around to optimizing it and cleaning it up a little.  We'll keep you posted.  Aslo, keep looking here for Doom 2 WADs.  We are curently developing a set of AWSOME deathmatch levels.  The 2 we have so far have kept us entertained for hours on end.  We also have a series of 1 player levels coming soon.
