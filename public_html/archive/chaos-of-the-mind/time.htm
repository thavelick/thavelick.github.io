<h3 align="center"><strong>Testing Time Hinders Learning</strong></h3>

<hr>

<p>Not only do standardized tests not help students learn, the
excessive time it takes to prepare and take tests actually
hinders student's ability to learn. Time that could be spent on
other subjects that are not tested by the tests is often denied (<a
href="works.htm#butl">Butler</a>). Teachers are often forced to
do less debate and problem solving in their classes because of
the time that must be spent preparing for standardized tests (<a
href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). Such debate and problem
solving activities are vital to survival in the real world.
Perhaps more so than arithmetic and grammar that most
standardized tests test (<a href="works.htm#deli">Delisle</a>).
In Japan, where typical standardized tests are at the center of
educational focus, students do poorly on tests that measure
problem solving ability (<a href="works.htm#butl">Butler</a>).
Mary Smith at Arizona State University conducted a study in which
she found that elementary schools spend and average of 100 hours,
or three to four weeks of school preparing for tests (<a
href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). Another study conducted by the
University of Colorado found that of 100 schools, 68% of teachers
did test preparation &quot;throughout the year&quot;. (Wagner).
Teachers from a school in New York were sent a memo from their
principal telling them to stop teaching social studies and
science in order to free up time for test preparation (<a
href="works.htm#scho">&quot;School Under Fire&quot;</a>). Too
much time is spent on preparing for standardized tests. Subjects
that are not taught, such as Social Studies and Science as a
result of this are often not given the complete focus they need.
Therefore, standardized tests should not be used as widely as
they are because they take instruction time away from other, just
as important subjects that may not be tested. </p>
