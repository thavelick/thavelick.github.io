<p><a name="desi"></a>First, one reason standardized tests should
not be used is they are an inaccurate assessment of student
performance. Most experts agree that in order to write a
successful, accurate test, standardized or not, a test writer
must consider aspects of the test: objectivity, validity and
reliability (Perrone 20) .An objective test is one that is not
affected by the bias of a particular test grader (Strenio 62).
Reliability refers to how close test scores from one area or
another reflect tests taken at different times, or how closely
results are to tests of the same type. Validity is defined as
&quot;the degree to which a test measures what it is supposed to
measure. . .&quot; (<a href="works.htm#perr">Perrone 21</a>).</p>

<p>Reliability is usually easily calculated by standardized test
companies. Most popular standardized tests have reliability
coefficients of between .87 and .93. Meaning the test is reliable
87 to 93 percent of the time. Although this is high, a very poor
test that can have a high reliability rating (<a
href="works.htm#perr">Perrone 20</a>).<br>
The strong point of most standardized tests is often advertised
as their high level of objectivity. They say that if the tests
are graded automatically, by a computer, they cannot be bias;
i.e. The test grader has no power to grade in a bias way, so the
test must be valid. What this analysis overlooks is the test
writer's ability to be subjective. The test writer can create
questions that are bias. Therefore, test results would be
inaccurate for those discriminated against. </p>

<p>Validity is often is not given as much attention as the other
two aspects by standardized test writers. For most standardized
tests, validity is determined by having an &quot;expert&quot;
look at the test and determine whether to content of the test is
valid in his opinion. Therefore, test validity is determined by
opinion, and not by scientific means. (<a href="works.htm#perr">Perrone
21</a>). A test writing company can write questions that bind the
test-taker to a &quot;narrow subset of rote memorization&quot; (<a
href="works.htm#stre">Strenio 63</a>) that can cause a student
who understands a concept that a question is supposed to test to
miss the question. This would make the test invalid, and
therefore inaccurate (<a href="works.htm#stre">Strenio 63</a>).
Because of standardized test's ability to be subjective and their
lack of true validity, test scores should not be taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="alti"></a>Another reason standardized tests scores
can be inaccurate is teachers and school districts can alter
their curriculum to match the tests (<a href="works.htm#fost">Foster</a>).
Instead of teaching a skill and using the test to test that
skill, teachers will teach about a specific example they know
will be on the test (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). A
teacher may not even do this with the intention of being devious.
For example, Lorrie Shepard, a testing expert at the University
of Colorado says that if a teacher knew that the part of the
tests that tested reading ability talked about kangaroos, the
teacher would be foolish not to teach about kangaroos in their
class. (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). This means that the
student would be tested not on how well they read, but on how
much they learned about kangaroos. This kind of test prepping
would skew test results, even though it may not even be
intentional or illegal (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>).
Also, security measures cannot be used to prevent this. A teacher
cannot be forced to not teach about kangaroos simply because a
reading selection about kangaroos is on the upcoming test. This
kind of test prepping is therefore virtually unstoppable. If test
results are skewed, they are inaccurate and therefore useless.</p>

<p><a name="chea"></a>The accuracy level of standardized tests is
also significantly dropped by widespread cheating. In a 1990
survey, 35 percent of teachers in North Carolina admitted the
presence of cheating in their schools (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>).
A national survey in 1990 revealed that almost 10 percent of all
the teachers who took the survey said that they received pressure
to cheat from school administration (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>).
In 1989 12 out of 17 elementary schools in Trenton, New Jersey
passed the California Achievement Test for third grade. After
evidence of cheating came about, state officials monitored the
tests, only three out of 17 schools met the state's standard. (<a
href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). In 1988, the California State
Department of education reported that 40 California elementary
schools were caught cheating (<a href="works.htm#fost">Foster</a>).
The list goes on and on. If this kind of cheating is so
widespread that between 10-30% of teachers in various areas
report cheating, the results on standardized tests will obviously
be very inaccurate. When situations like these occur, the tests
become a tool to not see which students know more; they become a
tool to see what administrations lay more pressure on teachers to
cheat. </p>

<p><a name="secu"></a>The solution seems easy enough. If security
is so low on tests, why not simply raise the level of security?
But, most school districts cannot afford the high cost of
security. First, the cost of simply giving a standardized test is
extremely high. Most of the time it costs a school around eight
dollars per student to proctor an exam such as the Iowa Test of
Basic Skills (<a href="works.htm#olds">Olds</a>). Although it
does not seem so, this cost is enormously high If school
districts are only budgeted an average of around $5,200 per
student (<a href="works.htm#spee">Speer</a>). Eight dollars may
seem like a small chunk of that amount, but when one considers
the costs of teachers, textbooks, computers and school buildings,
the value of that $5000 skyrockets. That high eight dollar cost
only entails the cost to give the test.. This would not include
the cost of someone from outside the school or perhaps ever the
state to come in and make sure that cheating was not occurring.
The cost of test proctors, tamper proof test envelops, and
delivery of test booklets at the last minute, so that teachers
are not tempted to take a peek at the tests and quickly alter
their lesson plans, is out of the range that schools can afford
to pay (<a href="works.htm#wagn">Wagner</a>). Because it would be
too expensive for schools to heighten tests security, cheating on
standardized tests will continue indefinitely. This cheating will
continue to lead to inaccurate, misleading test results. </p>
