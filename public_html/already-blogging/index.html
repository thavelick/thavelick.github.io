  <h1>Thinking of starting a blog? You likely already have</h1>
  <small>Posted 2019-11-24</small>
  <p>My recent return to updating my website and finally getting
  around to starting a blog on my own site was inspired in large part
  by Alexey Guzey's article on <a href=
  "https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">Why you should start
  a blog right now</a>. In it, he helped me overcome my biggest
  objections to starting. First, he convinced me that it doesn't
  matter if I don't come up with anything original to say:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Consider a university professor teaching a course. Does she say
  anything original? Do you think she should cancel her course
  because somebody else discovered the things she wants to teach? Or
  does she have to cancel her course simply because there is a
  similar course at some other university?</p>
  <p>Or consider yourself. Do you avoid having conversations with
  your friends when you think you have nothing original to say? Do
  you share things with them? Do you give advice? Do you help to
  understand things?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Second, the article gave me a lot of ideas on where to find
  something to write about including:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Scouring old IM logs and emails for things you said that seemed
  useful to others.</li>
  <li>Looking at comments you've made on other peoples posts.</li>
  <li>Thinking about advice you repeatedly give to friends.</li>
  <li>Look through notes taken when researching different
  topics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This got me thinking about other sources I could use for article
  ideas and it hit me: I'd already written a lot of article-like
  content but it was spread scattershot over the web. I then
  collected a few of these, made some minor edits and they became the
  first few articles on this site. The oldest of which I adapted from
  a StackOverflow post I wrote all the way back in 2008! If you're
  starting a blog, you should look around the web to find things
  you've already written and consider adding them as back dated posts
  on the new site.</p>
  <h2>Where to find articles you've already written to add to your
  blog</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of places you can probably find content you've
  written that you can adapt to blog articles. Some you can likely
  import directly into your blog and others you might need to edit
  and or flesh out a little.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Posts you've written on third party blogging platforms like
  Medium, Blogger or BlogSpot.</li>
  <li>Questions you've asked or answered on Q&amp;A websites like
  Quora, StackOverflow or StackExchange. In these cases you might
  need to edit them a bit so they make sense in a more narrative
  form, but doing so is probably quicker and easier than you
  anticipated.</li>
  <li>Forum posts.</li>
  <li>Entries from your personal journal (it's probably a good idea
  to heavily edit these and obviously not post everything en
  masse).</li>
  <li>Articles or documentation you've written for work that might be
  useful for a wider audience. Check with your boss before adapting
  any of this work, but chances are they'll approve so long as you
  aren't revealing anything proprietary or that could be a security
  risk.</li>
  <li>If you're a programmer, README's from open source tools you've
  developed.</li>
  <li>Notes you've taken when learning something new.</li>
  <li>Content you've written on old, now defunct websites accessed
  through the <a href="https://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback
  Machine</a>.</li>
  <li>Content that has been removed by changing moderation standards.
  When I wrote the original post behind my article on getting
  <a href="/breaking-into-coding">my first software development
  job</a> on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>
  they allowed open ended questions. When the site decided to focus
  on questions with more definitive answers, my answer was removed by
  moderators even though many people found it useful. Adding it to my
  blog makes this long missing advice public again.</li>
  <li>Long posts from Facebook or Twitter threads that others outside
  your friend circle might find useful.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why you shouldn't worry about duplicating content</h2>
  <p>Collecting all of your writing in your blog can allow people
  that would otherwise only find one or two fragments of your writing
  to read all you've had to say if they are so inclined.</p>
  <p>Also, it's a great motivational exercise. It makes writing seem
  like a less daunting and new task. Once doing it, you'll realize
  you've actually been writing for years, and now have something to
  show for it. That should make future writing easier.</p>
  <p>SEO experts sometimes rail against duplicate content. This might
  make you think I'm crazy for advocating using it. However,
  generally <a href=
  "https://searchengineland.com/myth-duplicate-content-penalty-259657">
  duplicate content won't penalize your rankings</a>, it just won't
  count positively toward your rankings so content from the original
  site might rank more highly that the one on your new blog. If
  you're really worried about this you can add a <code>noindex</code>
  meta tag to the page to make search engines ignore it. That way at
  least people who come to your blog through other articles can still
  get value out of it.</p>
  <h2>It doesn't matter that your old writing wasn't that great</h2>
  <p>Think about one of your favorite blogs. One you've read for
  years perhaps. Go there, and click into the author's archives and
  read their first few posts. Chances are they will suck compared to
  what they're posting today. It's natural for writing to improve
  over time and for your thinking on a topic to change. Make minor
  (or even major) edits if you feel the need. Write some introductory
  text that gives context about what was happening when you wrote the
  article.</p>
  <h2>Don't stop with the old stuff</h2>
  <p>Of course, the idea here is not to just collect a bunch of old
  personal writing artifacts, but to give your blog (and your brain)
  a bit of a jump start. Once you've added a few older articles,
  spend some time to write some new ones. If your thoughts on a topic
  have changed, write a follow up post. Or write something entirely
  different.</p>
