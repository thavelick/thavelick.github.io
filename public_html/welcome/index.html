  <p><em>[I wrote this a couple years back in draft form and never
 got around to publishing it. I'm a little less enthusiastic about
 the "IndieWeb" revolution now, but it does serve introduce the blog
 reasonably well]</em></p>
<p>I'm joining the IndieWeb revolution by creating my own personal
 website again for the first time in years! A lot of the structure
 comes from the venerable Derek Sivers, Is built with GatsbyJS and
 is hosted on GitHub Pages. Soon I'll be porting all of my old
 facebook, twitter and medium posts over here, along with hopefully
 adding some new content.</p>
