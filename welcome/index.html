  <h1>An Obligatory Yet Useless Introduction</h1>
  <p><em>[I wrote this a couple years back in draft form and never
  got around to publishing it. I'm a little less enthusiastic about
  the "IndieWeb" revolution now, but it does serve introduce the blog
  reasonably well]</em></p>
  <p>I'm joining the IndieWeb revolution by creating my own personal
  website again for the first time in years! A lot of the structure
  comes from the venerable Derek Sivers, Is built with GatsbyJS and
  is hosted on GitHub Pages. Soon I'll be porting all of my old
  facebook, twitter and medium posts over here, along with hopefully
  adding some new content.</p>
